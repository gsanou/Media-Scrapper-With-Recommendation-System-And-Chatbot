      "When chemistry teacher Walter White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given only two years to live, he decides he has nothing to lose. He lives with his teenage son, who has cerebral palsy, and his wife, in New Mexico. Determined to ensure that his family will have a secure future, Walt embarks on a career of drugs and crime. He proves to be remarkably proficient in this new world as he begins manufacturing and selling methamphetamine with one of his former students. The series tracks the impacts of a fatal diagnosis on a regular, hard working man, and explores how a fatal diagnosis affects his morality and transforms him into a major player of the drug trade.\n",

Each of these is depicted accurately for both Br (bromine) and Ba (barium), except the electron shell configuration for Ba is copied verbatim from Br. The periodic table that the entry for Ba is visually extracted from contains the correct information. The creators were most likely aware of this, but thought the opening had enough merit to warrant this disregard for correctness under artistic license.\n",

      "If you are among the few who haven't seen it yet: believe the hype, it really is THAT good. Breaking Bad may not depict reality the way 'Generation Kill' or 'The Wire' did - but then it's not about that, either. From an artistic point of view - performances, writing, direction, camera, music - this show is every bit as good as the other two mentioned above, but unlike those, 'Breaking Bad' just wants to entertain and therefore enjoys a lot more creative freedom.The show plays like the daydream fantasy of any underachieving, struggling middle class family man who's had to bury all his dreams (I mean: who wouldn't want to be a meth-kingpin for a little while?), before it turns into a nightmare. One could almost say that 'Heisenberg' is Walter White's 'Tyler Durden'(for those who don't get the reference: watch 'Fight Club' - you won't regret it).For pure entertainment value, this is simply the best show I've ever seen. Every single one of the main characters has already reached the status of a screen icon - when does that ever happen?! Most fun I've ever had watching a TV-show and an instant classic.\n",

      "I was waiting to see how GOT ended. It should be the greatest but they failed miserably in the finale season especially the last 3 (mainly the finale) episode.Writers need to take notes and be more like breaking bad. They had they ending planned out from the begging. They didn't try and build a massive brand or following behind the show and extend their seasons to do so. They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.Thank you for existing.\n",

      "Drug wars, meth, the lot. I thought no thank you. I kept hearing how good it was and I kept saying: \"No thank you\" Last January I got sick, one of those illnesses you can't quite figure out. Maybe it was pre and post election depression, I don't know. But I stayed in bed for almost 10 days and then it happened. I saw the first episode and I was immediately and I mean immediately, hooked. I saw the entire series in 9 days. Voraciously. Now I had time to reflect. Why I wonder. When I think about it the first thing that comes to mind is not a thing it's Bryan Cranston. I know the concept was superb as was the writing but Bryan Cranston made it all real. His performance, the creation of Walter White will be studied in the Acting classes of the future. He is the one that pulls you forward - as well as backwards and sideways - then I realized that his creation acquired the power that it acquired, in great part thanks to the extraordinary cast of supporting players. I could write a page for each one of them but I'm just going to mention Aaron Paul. I ended up loving him. I developed a visceral need to see him find a way out. Well, what can I tell you. I know that one day, maybe when my kids are old enough, I shall see \"Breaking Bad\" again. I can't wait.\n",

      "Breaking Bad starts with a series of very interesting questions to analyze, what would you do at the end of your life? What actions would you take to improve your well-being and that of those around you? Did you really live your life?.Throughout the series we see an evolution in all the characters, from Walter, a chemistry professor who after a series of events ends up being a methamphetamine drug dealer to Skyler, who goes from being a mother who takes care of her family to be a victim of Walter's actions and then an accomplice.Everything in this serie is connected, each chapter creates its own atmosphere and constantly analyzes the actions of the characters, from how they behave, what decisions they make for their benefit and how each one faces the problems generated by their own hand.It is a difficult oeuvre to digest since everything is constantly changing, from the first to the fifth season; But this is what makes Breaking Bad such a recognized oeuvre. Each chapter lays the foundation for what it sells in the future and that causes tension to be generated. Each character handles different situations that lead him to relate to others and this generates a story; But not just any story, but a great story.From the first to the last scene we see different angles, tones and shots that reflect the thoughts, emotions and ideas of each character on camera. There are several moments when a scene takes on a different color and this makes us familiar with a particular character, moment or situation, which makes the scene in question speak for itself and give us a context without telling us directly (such as the scenes in the desert to give an example). Each color used generates a familiarity with the viewer and makes the moments seen throughout a chapter important and easier to remember in future chapters and settings.Thus, Breaking Bad is a serie that brilliantly relates events and situations throughout each chapter, with music (composed by Dave Porter) and the different songs that are used throughout the series, raise to a higher level events that are already exciting to see.Breaking Bad is a serie that must be seen by everyone, without doubt, a piece that marks a before and after.\n",

      "Many years ago, a friend of mine told me to watch this new series called Breaking Bad. The way he raved about it I thought I'd give it a go just to shut him up. I really couldn't get in to it and, after the pilot episode, gave up and didn't watch it any more.\n",

      "Now, I don't know if I've changed in these past years or I just didn't give it long enough first time round but, Wow! Over the last three weeks I have binge watched the entire series, averaging four episodes a day (unfortunately I have to work as well). What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said by other reviewers who are more grammatically articulate than I am. It easy to see why Breaking Bad won as many awards as it did. The writing is superb, not to mention the acting from its two main stars, Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul as Walt and Jesse. By the end of the last episode I felt my heart was broken. Like a break up in a relationship I would now have to get by without these two in my life. It's been an emotional rollercoaster of a ride but I enjoyed every minute of it. From Jesse's awkward moment having dinner with Walt and Sky, to Walt's maniacal laughter whilst under the floorboards of his house.\n",

      "I probably haven't been hooked to a TV show like I am to Breaking Bad before. This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I've read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we'd see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week! 10/10 Kudos to Mr. Gilligan, kudos to Mr. Cranston and kudos to everyone else who's making a contribution to this show!\n",

      "BREAKING BAD:Season One explodes like a sucker punch to the gut, and is nothing short of mind-blowing. The pilot for this series is a definite \"Must See\", and stands with the greats of Action/Adventure Television and Cinema. This segment begins at such a giddy peak, that you think the only way forward would be to tell the tale as a long flashback. However, through a marvelous piece of editing and writing, the plot miraculously moves forward from that point. Bryon Cranston's idiosyncratic performance is a joy to behold. He embodies a man who is against a rock, and an even harder place, who has no other option but to throttle his higher aspirations and grimly carry on. His solace and validation in middle-class morality and virtuous conduct is long gone. I eagerly look forward to more of this ambitious, entertaining series.\n",

      "I have to echo another reviewer on here and say that as of the past many years I have not watched television, save PBS, Discovery, or History channel. And the news, of course. There has been nothing except The Sopranos and Family Guy in the realm of series that warranted my attention. Almost everything out there is stupid drivel that insults the intelligence of educated human beings. But Now !! Now we have Breaking Bad !!!All I can say is: HOLY S**T !!! This is the best television series I've ever seen, and really goes into the realm of feature films as well, as far as being in my top ten. I cannot think of anything as of late that punched me in the face like this show did. I absolutely love it. If you have not seen it, do yourself a HUGE favor and rent the first season so you'll know what's going on, and you can see the transition of the characters. This show is beautifully written with plot twists coming in refreshing ways, and at just the right times. Some of what is shown I was surprised they put it on television,... and that's a great thing !! The acting is brilliant, and the themes are amazing, timeless and timely, and are presented to us in thought provoking ways that leave me pondering philosophical ideas long after the show is over. Yeah, this is a TV series !!! On AMC !! Hard to believe. This is one I'm raving about to everyone I know, and hope keeps going for a long, long time !!! Thanks to everyone involved with this genius show !!!\n",

      "\"Breaking Bad\" is the best television show. Ever.We start out with one main character, Walter White (played by Bryan Cranston), who is struggling to make ends meet working both as a high school chemistry teacher and part time at a car wash. Then he gets diagnosed with cancer. Then he breaks bad.Teaming up with an unlikely sidekick, Jesse Pinkman (played by Aaron Paul), who is the immature \"yo, bitch\"-spouting, high-school-screw-up small-time drug dealer, Walt and Jesse both put their skills towards the drug world to try to make good by their families.This show has been masterfully put together with layer upon layer of insight into some of the most interesting characters ever realized in the history of television. We have some very dark characters, and a lot of grey characters, and it all adds up to brilliant dialogue and plot lines.The creator, writers, directors and actors have paid attention to every single detail, putting thought into every nuance in every character in every scene. Because of this attention to detail there is something for everyone in this show. Every thinking brain will immediately be attracted to the intelligence so evidently on display, that even if you're not a drug dealing chemist living in Albuquerque, you will find something in the characters that connects you to them and makes you hang on for dear life.Get on your couch now and start watching \"Breaking Bad\" from the very beginning, and don't miss a single scene.\n",

      "The age of Bryan Cranston has returned. Once universally lauded for his work in Malcolm In The Middle, there had yet to be a good vehicle for this man's particular talents. He has that rare gift of generating sympathy and manic-energy at the same time.For those that would be content to label this show a Weeds knock-off, bear in mind that Breaking Bad is a new kind of monster. It touches on the very same themes, \"living realistically as a middle class in the United States\" which often makes us resort to extremes to survive. Like the mother and daughter team that robbed that bank. But the weed selling antics of Showtime's hit show is really nothing like \"Bad.\" The Pilot was about as perfect a Pilot as I've ever seen, and much of it rests on Bryan Cranston's shoulders.Cranston plays Cheimstry teacher Walter White. He has a loving wife, a child with Cerebal Palsy and another is on the way. He also happens to be dying from an inoperable lung cancer situation, which happened although he \"never smoked.\" His finances in disarray, the once great student of science turns to crime to solve his problems.He cooks Crystal Meth with a good for nothing ex-student. From the antics of the first episode, the show is leading towards a dark place, but a place of truth. This is a no nonsense black comedy.For people that love Tarantino or the Coen's, this might be your cup of tea.\n",

      "It's 2019, I always heard good things from the show: It being 5th on top tv shows of all time on IMDB and the general talk about how this show is one of those rare ones that just gets better and better with each season. I had seen it was on Netflix but I never watched it until now because it was 5 seasons long and it just felt like I was going to have to commit a lot of time.In all my boredom I finally decided to start watching it with no intention on actually finishing it. I just wanted to see the first few episodes to waste time on the day and see how the show is. I watched the first three episodes of the first season and I was intrigued. I thought it was good, but not to the level I was being told it was. I eventually got to halfway through the second season and I stopped watching for about a week. I wanted to see this badass Mr White that everyone was talking about but I was dissatisfied with how far he was from that at the S2E5 mark. I grew impatient and decided to stop. This is completely my fault. Not the show's. I knew there had to be a story behind his transformation but I didn't have the commitment to see it. After a week I finally decided to watch S2E6 and after that I was immediately hooked. Less than 2 weeks later I had finished watching the entire show. I just couldn't stop.For some reason I thought the show would end with Mr White being a badass, taking out all the bad guys and living happily ever after with his family. I had no idea it would turn into a tragedy story: a man desperate to earn money to provide for his family for when he dies of cancer, ends up losing his family as they hate the man he has become. This show becomes very dark in its final stages. Jesse and Walter become enemies in the final season. Hank and Andrea are mercilessly shot in the head. Walter's family and the entire country turn against him. I actually teared a little when Walter saw his baby daughter, Holly, for the last time in the final episode; not even a month had passed since S1E1 but I still cried, that's how good this show is.This is a messy review and I dont care.If you're in a similar position to what I was in: wanting to watch the show but not feeling committed to its 5 season duration - just go for it. You won't be disappointed.\n",

      "Everybody has their own opinion of how many stars a show deserves, whether more stars or fewer it's seldom so many people agree. \"Breaking Bad\" is possibly the best TV drama ever made - there isn't a wrong step, bad episode or miscast character throughout the whole series run. A willing suspension of disbelief is an absolute requirement to enjoy this drama. It is probably not plausible to believe that anyone like Walter White could succeed as a meth chemist for even one season without being killed or caught let alone the 62 episodes the series has. But the tight, virtually seamless story, and the sympathetic characters, who nearly all resonate with most viewers, make you willing to set aside any differences with plausibility (which, admittedly, the show takes huge liberties with). Like most serials it is best not to watch the show out of order! More then any other series, huge changes in plot, story and character arc take place so fast you are likely to be completely lost if you skip episodes. And the show is the proverbial roller coaster, taking you to the low points and peaks right along with your favorite characters, you might not want to miss a minute in this original and daring TV drama once you start watching!\n",

      "Absolutely one of the most ground breaking bad ass shows on the screen, (pardon the pun). Definitely not for everyone but finally something that feels real.I personally like the fact they pull no punches. I find myself pausing at the fact that I am so intrigued by this hard core street wise program, more than any of the other big name series. This one really hits home and gives a true behind the scenes look at what most would consider the bad guys. I'm not condoning the contents of the story, and I don't think the show is either, there is no glamor in what these boys are doing, but it's giving an insight to the darker side of many streets. How the denial and desperation that can occur to the common working stand up citizen, the pillar of society that suddenly changes his moral standing in a society driven by the almighty dollar. This is pretty dam close to Fallen (Michel Douglas) but with up to date street smarts nd a lot more punch. The characters don't over exaggerate their roles and the story line isn't filled with cleaver dialog or near to impossible feats of bravery or beating impossible odds. Just true to life screwed up events that could take place in the real world. I think they did their research on this one. Good work everyone. I hope we get more than a second and third season out of this great crew (every one of them). From the writing and production sets to the acting, costumes, lighting, filming and originality. I've seen a few good series lost to the wrong decision makers, hope this one doesn't end up short (long live FireFly)Chuckbytes\n",

      "I started watching Breaking Bad quite late (around the time of my first year in college, so we're talking 2012-2013, right before the final season aired) Everybody was praising the show to death, so eventually I gave in and decided to see for myself what all the fuss was about.Wow. Just wow.While the show has quite an unusual premise, it takes you along for the ride in every sense of the word. Bryan Cranston as Walter White has to be one of the best character portrayals I've ever seen. A major transition from Hal in Malcolm in the Middle. He succeeds in capturing every nuance of White, from overworked square to calculating crime lord.Aaron Paul's performance as Jesse Pinkman is fantastic also, displaying the utter tragedy of a wannabe meth peddler who happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. His dynamic with Cranston's White is brilliant and their chemistry (pardon the pun) is tough to beat.The cinematography throughout the show is beautiful. As a film graduate, I have the utmost respect for the production team for some of the shots and scenes they have captured over the duration of the show's airing. The editing as well should be heavily praised as well.As I said, for an unlikely setup; an overworked high school chemistry teacher diagnosed with lung cancer teaming up with a former pupil to cook methamphetamine to finance his family after he dies, it draws you into the drama.The supporting cast add so much to the story also. The likes of Gus Fring, Mike Ehrmantraut, Saul Goodman and Hank Schrader are instrumental to the development of the story and are excellently portrayed by the respective actors.People give Skyler a hard time for always being on Walt's back but let's take it from her perspective: her husband has become involved in a business that could potentially bring about the deaths of everyone in her family? Seems like a reasonable excuse to oppose him.In a sense, Walter Jr. is kinda the weak link. I mean, yeah fair enough, the actor and character has cerebral palsy, and RJ Mitte does a good job as the character, but he really doesn't go beyond eating breakfast in terms of character development, which is a shame. I would have loved to have seen a scene where he meets Jesse and confronts him. Ah well, too late now.Aside from this, Breaking Bad remains a masterpiece of television.\n",

      "I cannot believe that I disregarded this series for nearly 12 years. I assumed that it was yet another American Soap Opera. My son persuaded me to give it a watch. I am so glad that he did. I have been engrossed for the last six weeks watching the full 5 series. I cannot rate this highly enough. The characters, the storyline, the acting, in fact everything about this series was astonishing. Quite frankly I am lost for superlatives by which to describe this production. I will watch it over again in 10 years time when I will be nearly 80. By that time my memory will have begun to deteriorate and it will be like watching it afresh. I can't wait....\n",

With an apparently not very appealing central plot (without spoiler), a 50-year-old high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque diagnosed with stage-3 lung cancer who takes the decision to produce and sell drugs with a former student, the series grabs you in a witty plot full of suspense, black humor and violence during which the main character, Walter White played by Bryan Cranston, evolves while the spectator's feelings towards him do so as well.Once you finish watching it, it does not leave you indifferent, at the same time some unanswered question make you think about, why not, a spin-off or a potential continuation of the series in the future.\n",
